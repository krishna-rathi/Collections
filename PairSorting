How does Arrays.Sort() work? 
Internally the Sort method does call Compare method of the classes it is sorting.
To compare two elements, it asks “Which is greater?” Compare method returns -1, 0, or 1 to say if it is less than, equal, or greater to the other. 
It uses this result to then determine if they should be swapped for their sort.
